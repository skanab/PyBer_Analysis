# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Using Pandas and Matplotlib,  create a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type and summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers PyBer.


## Results:
Number of rides increases in city type become more dense and the average fair price is inverse to city density.

## Summary

Pyber must study it's the driver to rides ratio. They can use this analysis data to optimize the number of drivers on the road for each city type. Urban drivers far outpace the number of rides during the same period. Drivers are likely to quit if they are unable to make a living wage. PyBer has a lot of work to do to grow its ridership.
